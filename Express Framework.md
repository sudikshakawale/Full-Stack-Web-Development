# What is Localhost?
* Localhost is simply when we dont have a server on the internet and instead we want to host our server locally.
* so making our computer, the server of our websites back end and that is the local part of our hosting.

  # What is Port ?
  * The port is kind of equivalent to a bunch of doors on  our server computer, and each of these doors have an address.
  *  Each port is identified by a unique number, then different applications or different hardware can tap into a Particular port.
    And tjis way we can have multiple services running through the same computer withiout them interfering with each other so that eacj one can be listening on a particular port.
* we can check which port on our compute are currently.
command:
# netstat -ano|findstr"LISTENING"

# HTTP Request (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol)
* The transfor protocol basically describes this as a language, a language that allows computer to talk to each pther across the Internet.
* When computers want to talk to each other across the Internet, they need the hyper text transfer protocol,a different language that allows them to understsnd each other.
